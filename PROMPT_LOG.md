# 25F CS2910 Programming Project Generative AI Prompt Log

_Include all generative AI prompts your group used for completing this project_

For example:

- I am trying to implement a Library Management System for my second-year CS programming project. I want to have classes for Patrons, Books, DVDs, and the Library Management system itself. Are there other natural classes and subclasses that we should consider adding?
- Our implementation of the `contains(Book b)` method in our LibraryManagement System works by searching through the array of all books in the library and seeing if any matches the target `b`. Is there a more efficient way to do this?
-
  and ... Many more!
